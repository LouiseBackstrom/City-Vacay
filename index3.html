        <h2>New York Top Attractions</h2>
        <p><b>Times Square</b>, this world famous traffic intersection is also known as the Crossroads of the World, The Great White Way and the center of Manhattan. It is located at the junction between Broadway and 7th Avenue and is surrounded by important buildings displaying bright neon signs at all hours of the day and night. </p>
        
        <p><b>Empire State Building</b> is perhaps New York's greatest landmark, although it is no longer the world's tallest building it is still visited by over 3 million people annually. The Empire State was inaugurated in 1931 and is located on 5th Avenue, at the time it broke many world records and was nicknamed the 8th Wonder of the World. The building has also featured in countless movies including King Kong and Sleepless in Seattle.</p>
         
        <p><b>Brooklyn Bridge</b> is one of the country's oldest suspension bridges; it was constructed in 1883 and spans the East River connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn. It was designed by John Augustus Roebling who had designed a number of other important bridges in the US.</p>
